## MiMB-StrandPhaseR

This repository is provided for the convenience of readers of the book chapter "Chromosome-length Haplotypes with StrandPhaseR and Strand-seq", part of the Methods in Molecular Biology series. Cloning this repository is likely an easier way to obtain the short sections of code included with the chapter than either copying the code from a PDF or transcribing it from a paper copy.

With the exception of alignment.sh, none of these files are intended to be run as bash or R scripts. Instead, you should chop them up, comment out the sections you don't need, and run small sections at a time. The conda commands probably won't run properly as bash scripts.
