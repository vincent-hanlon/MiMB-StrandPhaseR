## MiMB-StrandPhaseR

This repository is provided for the convenience of readers of the book chapter "Chromosome-length Haplotypes with StrandPhaseR and Strand-seq", part of the Methods in Molecular Biology series. Cloning this repository is likely an easier way to obtain the short sections of code included with the chapter than either copying the code from a PDF or transcribing it from a paper copy. 

With the exception of alignment.sh, you can't just download these files and run them as scripts. For one thing, the conda environments won't behave nicely (you'll need to activate and deactivate them from the command line). Instead, you should chop up the files and comment out sections you don't need, then run individual lines and commands. Hopefully this saves you some typing.

A preprint of the chapter is hosted by the library of the University of British Columbia [here](http://hdl.handle.net/2429/80678).
